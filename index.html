        <h2>BREAKTHROUGH WITH FRIENDS</h2>
        <p>Chandler Muriel Bing is one of the main characters on the popular sitcom Friends (1994–2004), portrayed by the late Matthew Perry. Chandler has a very good sense of humor, and is notoriously sarcastic, an attribute he calls a defense mechanism he developed due to his parents' divorcing when he was a child. His best friends are Joey Tribbiani and Ross Geller. Chandler's main catchphrase is starting sentences with "Could that BE any more..."
            Throughout most of the series, Chandler is an executive specialized in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration, occupying high-grade positions such as Processing Manager and head of the office. Though he has a high pay, he frequently complains about his dislike of his job, even deciding to quit in Season 9, finding employment as a Junior Copywriter in an advertising agency; this is a job he greatly enjoys, demonstrated by his willingness to take an internship opportunity, even though it means having to start from the very beginning of a new career.</p>

            <h2>HEALTH AND ADDICTION</h2>
            <p>Perry had various health struggles over the years that his doctors often contributed to his substance abuse. In 2000, Perry was hospitalized with pancreatitis, a condition often attributed to alcohol and prescription Opioid abuse, the two specific disorders that Perry struggled with. He was in and out of the hospital with various ailments after that, including multiple stomach surgeries.

                However, it was not until 2018 when, after waking up in a hospital bed with no recollection of how he got there, Perry knew he needed to make a drastic change in his lifestyle. His colon had burst due to the severe misuse of OxyContin, a powerful and addictive prescription Opioid, and he had been in a coma for two months.
                
                “The doctors told my family that I had a 2% chance to live,” Perry recalled, and admitted that's when he knew he needed to make a drastic lifestyle change and started his journey towards sobriety once again.</p>
